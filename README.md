KNOWN PROBLEMS:

I think at this point we just need to work on the Polynomial overloaded addition operator. It doesn't work, and sometimes goes into an infinite loop. Once that's done I think we need to just sit down and input lots of random polynomials and try to break the program. Hopefully it won't break.
